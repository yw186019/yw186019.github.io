            <b>Start Matlab</b>
                To start matlab, simply type Matlab at the Unix prompt. Matlab should then
                start, and you get the Matlab prompt, >>.

                The most important commands in Matlab are:
                • help      --The command gives you help inside Matlab.
                • helpwin   --The command gives you a separate window with the help texts
                • helpdesk  --The command starts Netscape and gives you access to the extensive HTML help that comes with Matlab.

                If you type in help helpdesk at the Matlab prompt, you get:
                    HELPDESK Comprehensive hypertext documentation and troubleshooting.
                    +HELPDESK loads the main MATLAB Help Desk page into the Web browser.

            <b>: (colon)</b>
            <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html">Matlab doc about : (colon)</a>
                The : can be used in two ways: 
                First way:
                    To create sequences and for indexing. 
                    x= 1:10
                    gives the sequence
                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

                The other way:

                Using the colon is to gain access to all rows or columns of a matrix.
                A(1,:) means: the 1st row of A and all columns. 
                A(:, 2) means: all rows of A, and the 2nd column.

            <b>end</b>
                The keyword end is useful for indexing (and other things). 

                x = 1:10;
                x(3:end) = 7
                    1 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

                3:end   -- refers to elements 3 to the end of x. You can also use e.g.
                end - 1 -- refer to the second last element of x.

            <b>’ (transpose)</b>
            <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/transpose.html">Matlab doc about ’ (transpose) </a>
                Syntax:
                    B = A.'
                    B = transpose(A)

                Description:
                    B = A.' returns the nonconjugate transpose of A, that is, interchanges the row and column index for each element. 
                    If A contains complex elements, then A.' does not affect the sign of the imaginary parts. 
                    For example, if A(3,2) is 1+2i and B = A.', then the element B(2,3) is also 1+2i.

                Examples:
            <b>(A) Real number example</b>
                    Create a matrix of real numbers and compute its transpose. 
                    B has the same elements as A, but the rows of B are the columns of A 
                      and the columns of B are the rows of A.

            These two operators differ from each other

            (A)Using numbers
               The right division will be the conventional division we all day make use of, so
                    8/4 =2 

               Contrary to the right division, the left division reverse the division, meaning
                    8\4=4/8 = 0.5

            (B)Matrix division in 
               (1) The right Matrix divide
                   Let’s consider two Matrices A and B
            <img SRC="images/TwoMatries.png" />

                   Using the right division:
            <img SRC="images/RightDivision.png" />

                   Matlab code:
                        A=[1 2 ; 2 2];
                        B=[3 2 ; 1 1];
                        A/B % You can also use A*inv(B)

                   Result as:

            <img SRC="images/RightDivisionResult.png" />

                (2) The left Matrix divide
                    The left matrix divide is roughly the same as:
            <img SRC="images/LeftDivision.png" />
                    Which leads to a complete different result from the preceding operator.

                    This technique can be used to quickly compute the solution of the equation:
            <img SRC="images/AXB.png" />

            
                    Matlab code:

                    A=[1 2 ; 2 2];
                    B=[3 2 ; 1 1];
                    A\B % You can also use inv(A)*B

                    Result as:
            <img SRC="images/LeftDivisionResult.png" />
            

            <b>The most common mistake in Matlab </b>
            <b style="color:Tomato;">Confusing row and column vectors!!</b> 
            <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/matlab_vectors.htm">Row or Column Vectors in Matlab</a>

                We normally think of a vector as just a vector, but Matlab thinks of it as a matrix. 

                So the question is:
                    is the vector an n-by-1 matrix or an 1-by-n matrix?
                
                For example, let A = [1, 2; 3, 4]; and b = [1, 0];.
                    
                Then Matlab will respond to the command A*b by:
                    ??? Error using ==> *
                    Inner matrix dimensions must agree.

                because b is of the size 1-by-2 and not 2-by-1 as it should be. 

                Remember that size(b) gives you the size. You can fix this by using any of the following:
                
                    • Typing b in again, now as a column vector: b = [1; 0];
                    • Transposing b by using the ´transpose operator: b = b’;.
                    • Using the colon: b(:) returns a column vector, so b = b(:); also does the trick.


            <b>Create your own functions</b>
            <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-functions-in-files.html">Matlab doc about create your own functions</a>
                
                Suppose you want to create a function called myfirst
                that accepts two matrices as input arguments and returns their sum. 
                
                Then you would have to put these commands:
                    function sum = myfirst(v, w)
                    % sum the two inputs
                    sum = v + w;

                into a file called myfirst.m in your working directory. 
                
                Once you have saved it, you can invoke the function:
                myfirst(1, 0)
                myfirst([1, 2], [3, 4])

                If you look back at the function that you saved in myfirst.m, the first line:
                function sum = myfirst(v, w)
                tells Matlab that your function should return the variable sum, that its name is
                myfirst, and that it accepts two input arguments. 

                Finally, Matlab will print out that percented first line any time you say help myfirst.

            <b>Create your own scripts</b>
            <a href="https://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Extras_Mfile#:~:text=m).-,How%20to%20run%20the%20m%2Dfile%3F,the%20MATLAB%20command%20window%20prompt.">Introduction of m-files</a>
    
                You should also try to put the following into a file called, say, firstscript in
                your working directory:
                    A = eye(3);
                    b = ones([3, 1]);
                    x = A\b;

                and then type firstscript at the Matlab prompt. This simply runs the commands in the file.

                How to run the m-file?
                    After the m-file is saved with the name filename.m in the current MATLAB folder or directory, 
                    you can execute the commands in the m-file by simply typing filename at the MATLAB command prompt.

                    If you don't want to run the whole m-file, 
                    you can just copy the part of the m-file that you want to run and paste it at the MATLAB prompt.

            <b>Sin</b>

                To make a graph of y = sin(t) on the interval t = 0 to t = 10
                we do the following:

                &gt;&gt; t = 0:.3:10;
                &gt;&gt; y = sin(t);
                &gt;&gt; plot(t,y)

                Here is the result:

            <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="images/sine.gif">

                The command <TT> t = 0:.3:10;</TT> defines a vector with
                components ranging from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.3.
                The <TT> y = sin(t);</TT> defines a vector whose components are sin(0),
                sin(0.3), sin(0.6), etc.  Finally, <TT> plot(t,y)</TT> use
                the vector of t and y values to construct the graph.

                3. Create a Matlab function called ssolve that:
                    (a) Accepts three parameters, a, b, and n, in that order.
                    (b) Returns the solution to the following n by n system:
            <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="images/Q3.png">
                    as a column vector.
                    [Note: All entries in the matrix not explicitly mentioned are meant to be
                    zero].

            <b>Answer:</b>


                        function solution=ssolve(a,b,n)
                        A=ones(n,n);
                        B=ones(n,1);
                        for r = 2:n
                            B(r) = r;
                        end
                        B(n-1)=0;
                        A(1,2)=a;
                        A(20,1)=b;
                        A(20,2)=b;
                        A(20,20)=b;  
                        % solution=A\B;    this returns Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.                        
                        solution=B\A;

                4. Turn in a printout of the function ssolve and plots of the vectors
                    (a) ssolve(10, 0.1, 30)
                    (b) ssolve(2, -0.05, 50)
                    with the appropriate titles. Also turn in the code that generated these
                    figures.
